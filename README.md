# Community News App

Frontend sign-up form for [Community News Bot](https://github.com/fnplus/project-community-news-api). Allows the user to manage and manipulate their favorite  domains to receive regular news updates. 



In order to sign-up for the service you will need to sign in using your google account, all news updates will be sent to the email id associated with this account.



Once signed in, you will be greeted with the sign-up form where you can choose the domains that interest you. You can pick from the options provided by us or choose your own domain. The bot scraps for news based on the key words provided by you, so make sure that they are consistent.



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Deployment

In order to make the deployment process simple I have used the [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) npm package. So running the following command will deploy the app on GitHub pages.

### `npm run deploy`
